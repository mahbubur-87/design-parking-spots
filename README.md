# Design Parking Spots #
During my data science masters courses, I participated in a datathon in Berlin in 2022. There I worked on datasets of 1 district in Berlin and later I included this dataset with data of another district in my project of one data science course. I prepared a dataset from those 2 datasets of 2 Berlin districts to design parking spots. I illustrated some important findings which are helpful for the district city council officials.
